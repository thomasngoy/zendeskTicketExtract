Zendesk Ticket Program:
Written by: Thomas Ngoy

This program will make HTTP GET Requests to Zendesk using information given by the user in the terminal.
To run the program, type in to the terminal:

    python3 driver.py

Inside the driver.py file, the user can specify the API Token to use in the authentication process.
If the user would prefer to enter in the API Token on the command line, change the variable titled 'defaultAPI' to False

The program outputs the Ticket Data collected from Zendesk to a file titled 'tickets.txt'

If the user would like to specify their own date parameters for the query, launch the program in launch mode 2.
Launching in launch mode 1 will use the default date parameters (15-12-2019 12:00 PM UTC to 10-01-2020 12:00PM)
